# Guide-by-Touch-Modeling-and-Control-of-a-Robotic-Arm
Enable the robotic arm to adapt to my movements by sensing changes in force, achieving guide by touch.

# code.zip 
In this file, there are three python files for three types of demonstration:
### DragandMove.py 
User can drag the robotics are after you run this file.

### follow_traj.py
The arm will repeat the trajectory recorded in "record.npy" first, and then you can interrupt its move by directly dragging it.

### drag_and_repeat.py
After you run this file, you can drag the arm, and the arm can record its movement during certain seconds, and repeat it.


# show1 2 3.gif
These are the demonstrations after you run the three .py files above.

# How to realize
You are highly recommended to find the whole process in https://spiffy-trillium-247.notion.site/Guide-by-Touch-Modeling-and-Control-of-a-Robotic-Arm-b985b5dbb77944798f7b619486ea1807?source=copy_link.

Additonally, the whole project is final deployed to the robotic arm by numpy and kortex offical API.
